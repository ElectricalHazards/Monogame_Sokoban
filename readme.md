A monogame implimentation of sokobon that uses a procedural generation for sokobon levels based off of Joshua Taylor and Ian Parberry's paper in 2011 http://ianparberry.com/techreports/LARC-2011-01.pdf

Impossible levels are still possible as I have not implemented a check to see if a level is solvable, for now press Y to generate a new level of equal difficulty

Controls:

    Esc: Closes the game

    Y: Generate a new level of equal difficulty (If an impossible level is created)

    W: Move one tile up

    A: Move one tile to the left

    S: Move one tile down

    D: Move one tile to the right

    Z: Undo the last move

.NET Core desktop is required download at https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0/runtime, direct download links are below:

* [x64](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-5.0.7-windows-x64-installer)
* [x86](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-5.0.7-windows-x86-installer)
* [arm64](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-5.0.7-windows-arm64-installer)

I am unsure if the current release will work on any platform other than x64
